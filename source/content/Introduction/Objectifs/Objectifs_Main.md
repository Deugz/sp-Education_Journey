##  A Fun Activity

<p class="emphase">A Common Playground</p>

I believe it is very important that teachers and students share the same space and work and interact horizontally.

<p class="emphase"> our <strong>unique</strong> jigsaw puzzle </p>

Our research is often very narrow, however the problematics to whome our progress can have an impact is incredibely broad.

A single place where every researchers can bring his own piece to resolve the "Big Picture" puzzle.

<p class="emphase2">Reconciliate Art with Science</p>


<p class="emphase"> <strong>Art</strong> is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power. The natural world is of a <strong>phenomenal beauty</strong> and sciences goal is to describe this world so why not use artistic tools to teach ?</p>

<h4> <strong>Compiling knowledge </strong></h4>

::::{grid} 2

:::{grid-item}
:columns: 10

Like a DJ would do to build his set. A DJ set is a collection of individual tracks assembled in a coherent way to create a specific *vibe*. I found that I build knowledge incrementaly, and it is usefull for me to have a place to take notes about what I learn, and implement the ressources I discover along the way. Similarily to a DJ, that improves his setes with all the gems he found during his journey, this website is a place where I intend to implement all the <strong>teaching ressources</strong> I found and develop during my carreer as a researcher (those are my tracks).
